Signal’s Double Ratchet algorithm explained: [https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)

A website illustrating Signal’s Double Ratchet. Also allows you to insert your own data to see how things perform: [https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ratchet](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ratchet)

Same as above but without letting you play with your own data: [https://claucece.github.io/the-double-ratchet/](https://claucece.github.io/the-double-ratchet/)

Moxie Marlinspike on why he doesn’t support an open protocols (i.e. why Signal isn’t federated): [https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/](https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/)

> Cable is an encrypted instant messaging and voice calling application for Android. It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include images and video messages, and make one-to-one voice calls. Cable uses standard phone numbers as identifiers and end-to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Cable users.  
> Cable is based on Signal, but has some different goals.  
> This is not a company or a startup, it’s a project.

> The problems with Signal

> These are the limitation of Signal this project tries to address:

> Signal is a centralized service, run by a single entity: Open Whisper Systems. Cable aims to build a network of federated, independent servers.

> The Signal client has some proprietary dependencies, these are removed in Cable.

> Signal users Amazon S3 to store encrypted attachments. While everything is always end-to-end encrypted, we avoid Amazon and prefer self-hosted or noncommercial solutions.

> Signal is not friendly towards third-party clients using their servers, Cable is.
