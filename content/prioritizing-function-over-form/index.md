AIs direct search for materials breakthroughs — Robert F. Service [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6471/1295](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6471/1295)

> to refine a key material in solar cells to boost its electrical conductivity. But the number of potential tweaks was overwhelming, from spiking the recipe with traces of metals and other additives to varying the heating and drying times.…the robot mixed different solutions, cast them in films, performed heat treatments and other processing steps, tested the films’ conductivity, evaluated their microstructure, and logged the results. The AI interpreted each experiment and determined what to synthesize next. At a meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS) here last week, Berlinguette reported that the system quickly homed in on a recipe and heating conditions that created defect-free films ideal for solar cells. “What used to take us 9 months now takes us 5 days,” Berlinguette says.

“Other material scientists reported successes with such “closed loop” systems that combine the latest advances in automation with AI that directs how the experiments should proceed on the fly.”

\> The bad news, he says, is that most are unremarkable, making the challenge of finding gems a needle-in-the-haystack problem.

\> But simply plodding through recipe after recipe is a slow route to a breakthrough, Maruyama says. “High throughput is a way to do lots of experiments, but not a lot of innovation.”
