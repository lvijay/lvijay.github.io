Almost all readings of philosophy purport to discuss how one ought to live ones life, what one ought to be doing, what is moral and so on. Thankfully, there exists a department of philosophy which, as far as I know, doesn’t deal with these matters. No, this department discusses more important matters like:

-   is the number 3 real? 
-   h̶o̶w̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶r̶o̶a̶d̶s̶ ̶m̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶ ̶w̶a̶l̶k̶ ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶ how many pieces of your LEGO® house can you replace before it’s a different house?
-   what is there? everything. what isn’t?
-   are pains real?
-   what’s the meaning of meaning?
-   something something _Hesperus_ _Phosphorus_
-   what is it like to be a bat?
-   let’s take out your brain, put it in a jar, hook it up to some wires, and wirelessly transmit the signals to your body. now your body’s standing in front of your brain. are you looking at your brain or are you looking at yourself?
-   is water H₂O?

Analytic Philosophy is this branch of philosophy. The underlying premise behind it is to arrive at any and all conclusions from what are called _first principles_.
