The Frame Problem was first discussed in 1969 by AI researchers John McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes \[TK footnote\]. The paper’s title is a mouthful — “_Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence_” — but is a great read. Put briefly, the Frame Problem tries to codify _that which does not change_.

In their paper, McCarthy and Hayes write down the logical operations that a person must keep track of when telephoning another. They note that “in proving that one person could get into conversation with another, we were obliged to add the hypothesis that if a person has a telephone _he still has it_ after looking up a number in the telephone book.” (my emphasis)

It turns out this is not a trivial problem to solve. They continue, “if we had a number of actions to be performed in sequence we would have quite a number of conditions to write down that certain actions do not change the values of certain \[facts\]. In fact with _n_ actions and _m_ \[facts\] we might have to write down _mn_ such conditions.” (TK footnote)

They define a _Frame_ as a state to which “number of \[facts\] are declared as attached… and the effect of an action is described by telling which \[facts\] are changed, all others being presumed unchanged.”

In the Mahabharata, for example, when Satyavati crosses a river, she remains female but if Amba, a woman, is reborn Shikhandi, it’s the same person but now male. Thus, femaleness is part of the Frame when crossing a river but not part of the Frame during rebirth. (Perhaps gender is not part of the Frame only during birth.)

⁹ In the Frame Problem, McCarthy and Hayes use the techincal word _fluent_ but for this post, I’ve kept to the simpler word _fact_. For the purposes of this post, there’s no loss in meaning.
