Sherlock Holmes (left) and Prof. Moriarty

In the Sherlock Holmes story, _The Final Problem_, we first meet the great detective’s arch-nemesis, Prof. Moriarty, who, the story goes, was a “malefactor” and a “deep organizing power” behind crimes “of the most varying sorts — forgery cases, robberies, murders”. “An antagonist who was \[Holmes’s\] intellectual equal” around whom Holmes had “woven \[a\] net” “all ready to close” but Moriarty gave the police “the slip”. After escaping from the police, the story continues, Moriarty met Sherlock Holmes at the cliff of a waterfall, dueled him and they both fell to their deaths. Except, it turns out, Holmes didn’t fall. Upon his return in _The Empty House_, Holmes explains that he “slipped through \[Moriarty’s\] grip” using his knowledge of “baritsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling” ¹ and Moriarty alone fell to his death.

It is my thesis here that Moriarty was not an evil mastermind but a wronged man about whom we know nothing. Additionally, I’ll argue that Sherlock Holmes, not Moriarty, was the “malefactor” described above.

Here’s how I’m going to argue this. First, I’ll argue that Watson was fooled as was John “Scottie” Ferguson in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 thriller, _Vertigo._ Next, I’ll argue that Sherlock Holmes was both detective _and_ kingpin, akin to Tyler Durden in the 1999 movie _Fight Club_ (schizophrenia optional) after which I defend Moriarty as a man wronged. Finally, I attempt to answer the most interesting question: Why did Holmes turn to crime?

In this account, I’m going to take Dr. Watson’s narration as honest and Holmes’s as deserving skepticism. I can’t doubt everything. I’m not Descartes.

While the sloppy plot in _The Final Problem_ was mainly because Arthur Conan Doyle grew “weary” of Sherlock Holmes, held that his character “tended” to “obscure” his “higher work” and kept his “position in literature” from being a “more commanding one”, my arguments in this post will remain purely within the realm of the Sherlock-Holmes-Universe. ²

### Does Moriarty Exist?

Were it not for this one sentence (shown below) from _The Final Problem_, that independently corroborates the existence of Mr. James Moriarty, I’d argue that such a man didn’t actually exist but was a fiction invented by Sherlock Holmes. As it stands, my argument is that though Moriarty existed, he didn’t commit the crimes Holmes said he did.

> My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred.

Notice how the brothers Moriarty have the same first name? Since Watson and co do not inhabit the world of William Shakespeare’s _The Comedy of Errors_,³ this is evidence Holmes was the true evil mastermind. Or so I’ll argue.⁴

### Watson Fooled

We don’t know what Prof. Moriarty looks like. We have exactly two descriptions of Moriarty, one from Holmes, and one from Watson. And they hardly count as corroborating one another. Below excerpts are all from _The Final Solution_. Here’s Holmes:

> \[Moriarty\] is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in this head…. His shoulders are rounded…, and his face protrudes forward.

When Watson and Holmes board a train supposedly fleeing Moriarty, Holmes looks at the platform and says, “Ah, there is Moriarty himself”. And _just by coincidence_, the “train had already begun to move as Holmes spoke”. Here’s Watson:

> a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped.

The description is so vague it could just have been a man angry about missing his train. Or, (my thesis), an actor hired by Holmes.

Further into the story, Watson and Holmes are vacationing in the Alps (supposedly hiding from Moriarty) when Holmes leads Watson “near the edge” of a waterfall that “plunge\[d\] into a tremendous abyss”.

Upon being led into this beautiful and conveniently dangerous location, Watson receives word from a messenger of an “English lady” who, “absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician” but insisted “it would be a great consolation to her to see an English doctor”. As Watson himself puts it, it “was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow countrywoman dying in a strange land”. The perfect excuse to draw Watson away from what he considered his most important responsibility — protecting Holmes. Who but Holmes could invent a ruse _guaranteed_ to make Watson withdraw?

Remember, for all his alleged brilliance, Moriarty didn’t even know what Sherlock Holmes looked like. When they allegedly first met, all Moriarty said was, “You have less frontal development that I should have expected”. When he knew nothing about Holmes, his enemy, how could he be expected to invent a story so perfect that it would make Watson leave his friend?

If one were to stage one’s death, Holmes couldn’t have chosen a better spot: a “three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other” (see image below). A place with no means to detect a dead body. In his amateurish attempt to play detective Watson notices “\[t\]wo lines of footmarks… leading away from” the waterfall. Watson peered into the waterfall but it was by then dark and he “could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft, the gleam of the broken water”. Indeed, as Watson himself puts it, “\[w\]ho was to tell us what had happened”?

At the waterfall, Watson finds three pages from Holmes’s notebook, addressed to him; “writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study”. We are to believe that before his tête-à-tête with Moriarty, Holmes had sufficient time to place these notes in a place that Watson would find.

Holmes’s letter claims Moriarty called for their meeting at the waterfall. But that leaves unanswered how Watson was called away so perfectly. Furthermore, if Moriarty was going to pick a place, he would be expected to choose better defenses for himself, not give Holmes an even chance of survival. The entire setup _is_ believable, however, if we allow that there was no Moriarty and Holmes wanted the perfect spot from which to stage his death.

Great drawing. Except it never happened.

### Sherlock Holmes, master criminal

Okay, so Watson was fooled. This is hardly surprising because Watson is always fooled. But it is now time to expand on Sherlock Holmes’s description of himself as “the specialist in crime”. We address this in two parts. First, I show Holmes’s capacity for crime and his criminal connections. Next, I show how Holmes’s accusations of Moriarty are completely out of character. Of course, since I cannot prove that Holmes _was_ the criminal mastermind, I shall merely present facts that point in that direction. As the master detective himself says, (_The Noble Bachelor_):

> My whole examination…turn\[s\] my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s example.

#### A capacity for crime

As early as _The Sign of the Four_, Watson recognizes something about his friend:

> I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense.

At various other times we see that Sherlock Holmes has many connections to the underworld. In _The Illustrious Client_, Holmes claims to have an agent “in the huge criminal underworld of London” who “obtain\[ed\] information which often proved to be of vital importance”.

In _A Scandal in Bohemia_, Watson describes his friend’s acting ability thusly:

> It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

In _The Man With The Twisted Lip_, Watson finds his friend hanging around in an opium den — a center for criminal activity — disguised as an “absorbed” “old man”, “very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees” a font of “doddering, loose-lipped senility”. Holmes admits to Watson that he’s at the den to “find an enemy” and he has “used it \[the opium den\]” in the past for his “own purposes”. Holmes also casually lets slip that the opium den’s crime boss “has sworn to have vengeance upon” him. As always, when it matters, Holmes is skimpy on why and Watson, good at reporting but not so much at journalism, doesn’t enquire.

When I call an opium den a center for criminal activity, I’m not stereotyping. This is Holmes on the opium den:

> We should be rich men if we had £1,000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside.

Left unspecified are _who_ bear responsibility for the deaths of these “poor devils”. Watson only assumes the best of his friend.

#### Sherlock Holmes: crime boss

In _The Final Problem_, Holmes boasts that “there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do”. And, remember, this was a boast made while Moriarty was still alive, active, and unapprehended.

Speaking of Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes cannot but describe his “nemesis” in terms of glowing admiration. In the passage cited below, note the lack of names and exclusive use of pronoun.

> He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organized. Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed — the word is passed to the Professor, the matter is organized and carried out. The agent may be caught. In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. But the central power which uses the agent is never caught — never so much as suspected.

Allow me to repeat that last sentence, “the central power which uses the agent is never caught — never so much as suspected”.

In _The Valley of Fear_, Holmes further gives away his hand. Consider this conversation with Watson:

> You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?”  
> “The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as — “  
> “My blushes, Watson!” Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.  
> “I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.”

Notice that Watson is utterly oblivious to the connection but Holmes, in his guilt, assumes it’s high praise that Watson was about to deliver.

Or consider again, the end of the above novel: Sherlock Holmes advises Mr. Jack Douglas to leave England so he may escape the evil clutches of Prof. Moriarty. Douglas duly boards a ship to South Africa and Holmes receives a telegram from Mrs. Douglas: “Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St Helena. No one knows how accident occurred.” Holmes is unsurprised, and says “no doubt it was well stage-managed” and that Mr. Douglas was “surely” “murdered”.

As usual, Holmes lays blame upon Mr. Moriarty, describes the crime as being “from London” because he can “tell an old master by the sweep of his brush”.

Holmes, by virtue of having “solved” the crime is absolved of all blame but coincidentally and conveniently all people who were a threat to “Moriarty’s” organization are no longer cause for concern either. Talk about a win-win scenario.

“But for what motive” did Jack Douglas have to die? Holmes explains this earlier in the novel. It’s the standard mafia explanation, where the organization expends an “absurd extravagance of energy” into “crushing the nut”:

> I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death…. His punishment followed, and would be known to all — if only to put the fear of death into them.

Replace “Moriarty” with “Holmes” and tell me it isn’t a perfect fit.

When discussing the criminality of Moriarty, Holmes’s rhetoric reduces to that of a conspiracy theorist. All crime is indicative of Moriarty’s guilt and a lack of evidence, rather than weakening, is presented as _strengthening_ the case.

> “You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?” said \[Sherlock Holmes\].  
> “Never,” \[said Watson\].  
> “Aye, _there’s the genius_ and the wonder of the thing!” he cried. “The man pervades London, and _no one has heard of him. That’s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime_.” \[my emphasis\]

My theory is that Holmes does this so he can concurrently boast about his genius while concurrently keep from implicating himself.

Because remember, we are discussing Sherlock Holmes. A man, who, at all other times was “the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen” (_A Scandal in Bohemia_), who advises that “detection is…an exact science, and should be treated in \[a\] cold and unemotional manner” (_The Sign of the Four_) and — correctly, in my opinion — points out “\[i\]t is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data \[as\] it biases the judgment”. 

Except where it comes to Moriarty, it seems. Could it be because Holmes knows more than he lets on?

#### Schizophrenia optional

This is Holmes’s relay of an alleged conversation with Moriarty.

> “‘All that I have to say has already crossed your mind,’ said he.  
> “‘Then possibly my answer has crossed yours,’ I replied.

### Moriarty, a man wronged

Why Moriarty, though? Who was he? Why did the great detective Sherlock Holmes choose him as proxy for his criminal enterprise?

#### _James?_

In _The Final Problem_, Watson claims he’s responding to “recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother”, Prof. Moriarty. In The Empty House, Sherlock Holmes names his adversary, Professor James Moriarty. Given that Watson was responding to public letters, it’s safe to say that Watson got the name right and Holmes got it wrong. 

Clearly, Holmes forgot the first name of his fake nemesis. There’s no other possible explanation.⁴ The same Sherlock Holmes whose “index of biographies” includes “Matthews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross”. If he remembers a knocked out tooth, it’s inconceivable that he’d forget the name of a man with whom he had a fight to the death.

We don’t know exactly what Col. Moriarty said in his “letters” “defend\[ing\] the memory of his brother” but if I were to speculate, I would say that the colonel defended his brother as an innocent man who had no part in Holmes’s allegations. Nothing in _The Final Problem_ actually proves the case against Prof. Moriarty.

#### Who was Moriarty?

Here’s what we know about Prof. Moriarty. “At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem…\[o\]n the strength of \[which\] he won the Mathematical Chair at one of \[England’s\] smaller universities.” Unfortunately for Moriarty, a promising mathematician, with “a most brilliant career before him” which ended due to unsubstantiated “\[d\]ark rumours \[that\] gathered round him in the university town,” as a consequence of which he was “compelled to resign his chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an army coach”. That is all we know.

There’s no evidence whatsoever regarding Moriarty’s involvement in any sort of crime. In _The Valley of Fear_, Holmes further gives the game away in saying there’s no evidence against Moriarty.

> \[I\]n calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law — and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations — that’s the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year’s pension as a solatium for his wounded character.

#### Why Moriarty?

There exists the ever persistent myth that an expertise in one domain automatically confers expertise in other unrelated domains. And since mathematics, that most abstract of fields, is so difficult, a genius mathematician could also be a genius criminal. I don’t think Sherlock Holmes himself made this error but I claim he used the existence of the myth to divert suspicion towards “ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity”.

#### Whither evidence?

I’ll end with Inspector Alec MacDonald, Scotland Yard, whose “practical Scotch intelligence” leads him to ask Holmes a most pertinent question:

> You’ve got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime.

The answer, rather unsurprisingly, is no.

### Why did Holmes turn to crime?

We will never know the full reasons behind why Sherlock Holmes turned to a life of crime nor why he left it behind but we have some hints. I believe Holmes turned to crime to escape his drug addiction and, once he’d kicked the habit, ended his criminal enterprise too. In other words, it’s the age old story of boy does drugs, to quits drugs boy turns to crime, boy quits drugs, boy quits crime.

In _The Sign of the Four_, Watson witnesses Holmes inject himself “three times a day for many months” and describes his friend’s “sinewy forearm… all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks”. Holmes acknowledges that the influence of drugs “is physically a bad one” but he cannot stop because his “mind…rebels at stagnation”. Holmes also says “can dispense… with artificial stimulants” provided he has work. 

Unfortunately, there isn’t as much crime as Holmes would like. He complains to Watson in _A Study in Scarlet_ that:

> There are no crimes and no criminals in these days.… No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.

If we do not read about his drug addiction in the later stories it’s because (I claim) he found himself a new hobby — crime. Holmes, in many ways, is like those people who play chess games by themselves because they do not find worthy opponents.

### The end

What does one retire to after a life as the world’s “only unofficial detective” and “Napoleon of crime”? In the case of Sherlock Holmes, he chose to live “the life of a hermit” keeping bees. He wrote a book titled “Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen”.

It’s only fitting that I end this post with Holmes own words. The ambiguity is all Holmes.

> Alone I did it. Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when I watched the little working gangs as once I watched the criminal world of London.

² Here’s the full excerpt from Arthur Conan Doyle’s [autobiography,](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks14/1400681h.html#ch-11) _Memories and Adventures_, 1924

> At last, after I had done two series of them \[Holmes short story collections\] I saw that I was in danger of having my hand forced, and of being entirely identified with what I regarded as a lower stratum of literary achievement. Therefore as a sign of my resolution I determined to end the life of my hero. The idea was in my mind when I went with my wife for a short holiday in Switzerland, in the course of which we saw there the wonderful falls of Reichenbach, a terrible place, and one that I thought would make a worthy tomb for poor Sherlock, even if I buried my banking account along with him.

³ “Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name” _—_ [_The Comedy of Errors_](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/comedy_errors/index.html)_,_ William Shakespeare.

⁴ In truth, I think Arthur Conan Doyle made an honest mistake because the stories _The Final Solution_ (1893) and _The Empty House_ (1903) were published a decade apart. But if we wish to keep to a narrative that’s consistent and remains _within_ the Sherlock Holmes canon, I believe mine is the best theory.
