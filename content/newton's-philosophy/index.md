**Interviewer:** Dr. Pemberton, thank you for this interview. In what ways would you compare the science of your day and Machine Learning of today?

> The custom was to frame conjectures; and if upon comparing them with things, there appeared some kind of agreement, though very imperfect, it was held sufficient. Yet at the same time nothing less was undertaken than intire systems, and fathoming at once the greatest depths of nature; as if the secret causes of natural effects, contrived and framed by infinite wisdom, could be searched out by the slightest endeavours of our weak understandings. \[pg 4\]

**Interviewer:** How do you think we ought to proceed?

> \[T\]he only method, that can afford us any prospect of success in this difficult work, is to make our enquiries with the utmost caution, and by very slow degrees. And after our most diligent labour, the greatest part of nature will, no doubt, for ever remain beyond our reach. \[pg 4\]

**Interviewer:** Machine Learning experts say that all our cognition can be reduced to one phenomenon: that of generalizing from large data. Do you agree?

> To acquiesce in the explanation of any appearance by asserting it to be a general power of \[association\], is not to improve our knowledge in philosophy, but rather to put a stop to our farther search. \[pg 407\]

**Interviewer:** So, like Newton, you too believe that we must start with many rules first. Why do you think the human mind cannot be considered as a simple correlating machine?

> The thoughts of the human mind are too extensive to be confined only to the providing and enjoying of what is necessary for the support of our being. It is this taste, which has given rise to poetry, oratory, and every branch of literature and science. \[pg 3\]

**Interviewer:** Coming back to your philosophy of science, how to you think one ought to proceed?

> There are… but two methods, that can be taken in the pursuit of natural knowledge. \[pg 5\]

**Interviewer:** Okay, what’s the first one?

> One is to make a hasty transition from our first and slight observations on things to general axioms, and then to proceed upon those axioms, as certain and uncontestable principles, without farther examination. \[pg 5\]

> \[It\] follow\[s\] from the various sects of false philosophies… which \[I call\] empirical… where experiments are blindly adhered to, without proper reasoning upon them. \[pg 10\]

**Interviewer:** Okay, almost no one will dispute this is Machine Learning. What’s the other one? Presumably, the correct one.

> The other method;… is to proceed cautiously, to advance step by step, reserving the most general principles for the last result of our inquiries. \[pg 5\]

**Interviewer:** But how can you oppose the collection of large amounts of data by Machine Learners and Data Scientists? Do you think it won’t give us the eventual answers and explanations to causes?

Sir Isaac Newton, by this his invention \[the theory of gravitation\], has much advanced our knowledge in the celestial motions. By discovering that the moon gravitates towards the sun, as well as towards the earth; he has laid open those intricacies in the moon’s motion, which no astronomer, from observations only, could ever find out. \[pg 17\]

> So his extensive thought accomplish’d first  
> The mighty task to drive th’ obstructing mists  
> Of ignorance away, beneath whose gloom  
> Th’ inshrouded majesty of Nature lay.  
> He drew the veil and swell’d the spreading scene.

a

> O _Newton_, whether flies thy mighty soul,  
> How shall the feeble muse pursue through all  
> The vast extent of thy unbounded thought,  
> That even seeks th’ unseen recesses dark  
> To penetrate of providence immense.
