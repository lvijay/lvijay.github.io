_Question:_ Why does Apple provide free engraving for its earphones (AirPods® and other variants), tablets (iPad® and variants), and other products? \[[ref](https://www.apple.com/shop/engraving-and-gift-wrap)\]  
_Answer:_ Because the engraving reduces their resale value, which reduces the resale market’s supply, which increases new product sales thereby increasing profits.
