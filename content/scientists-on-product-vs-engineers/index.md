It’s typically assumed (but never actually addressed) that the idea is all that counts and given an idea its implementation is but a mere detail. In this post I examine the attitudes of scientists and philosophers on the topic. These are scientists who had both the ideas and did the hard work so it’s safe to assume they know what they’re talking about.

### Isaac Newton

Newton would’ve been utterly contemptuous of any that claimed credit for an idea without having actually done the hard yards of work. Robert Hooke, a contemporary of Newton at the Royal Society of London (a scientific institution), claimed that the idea of gravitation was his and went around complaining that Newton had stolen his ideas. Hooke did not claim to have worked out the necessary calculations. Upon hearing of these rumors, Newton was incensed and wrote the below in a letter to another scientist, Edmund Halley, after whom the Halley’s comet is named. Excerpt below:¹

> \[Hooke\] has done nothing & yet writtern in such a way as if he knew & had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to be determined by the drudgery of calculations & observations, excusing himself from that labour by reason of his other business: whereas he should rather have excused himself by reason of his inability. For tis plain… he knew not how to go about it. Now is not this very fine? Mathematicians that find out, settle & do all the business must content themselves with being nothing but dry calculators & drudges & another {that} does nothing but pretend & grasp at all things must carry away all the invention.

Newton had already worked out most of his Theory of Gravitation in 1766² but largely abandoned it for two reasons. First, because his theory assumed circular orbits which didn’t match Kepler’s findings that planetary motion around the sun was elliptical and secondly because Newton lacked accurate information about the earth’s size. As Dr. Henry Pemberton says in his 1728 book, _A View of Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophy_, at the time it was assumed that “_60 English miles were contained in one degree of latitude on the surface of the earth. But as this is a very faulty supposition, each degree containing about 69½ of our miles, his computation did not answer expectation; whence he concluded, that some other cause must at least join with the action of the power of gravity on the moon_”. Newton’s attention was once again drawn to this problem after he received a letter from Hooke, which led him to write his _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ (1687) where he first proposed his theory of gravitation. The rest is history.

### Charles Darwin

> Within late years several reviewers have given the whole credit \[on the close resemblance of the embryos within the same class\] to Fritz Muller and Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some respects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter on the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it is clear that I failed to impress my readers; and _he who succeeds in doing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit._ \[emphasis added\] ⁴

### Albert Einstein and Max Born

Pioneering physicists, Einstein and Born both felt that money and success were far less important than the satisfaction of real work. Consider below their exchange on the Russian mathematician, Romer, who they wanted to help. This is Einstein, in a letter to Born:

> \[I\]t would be gratifying if one could make it possible for him to do scientific work, and this could, of course, best be done by giving him some routine job which would leave him enough spare time for independent work. Unfortunately, such opportunities do not exist. Would it really be impossible to create grammar school teaching posts or similar official appointments for this kind of case, with a reduced number of teaching hours and pay? This would be definitely more satisfactory than grants for a limited period, for the stork is Bohemian when it comes to intellectual births, and refuses to accept a fixed delivery date.

And this is Born in his reply:

> The idea of giving him some sort of routine job which would leave him enough spare time for his scientific work is, of course, good in theory but extremely difficult to implement in practice. The establishment of grammar school teaching posts with reduced hours of teaching and lower pay is desirable.
