In this post I address the cliche that one must love their job to be successful. The common refrain is that one must like their job to be successful in it. Since such is never addressed empirically, only anecdotally, it shouldn’t be considered true. That said, it is repeated often enough. In this post I’ll discuss some people who were extremely successful in their careers but also hated their line of work.

When there’s data supporting both sides of a thesis, one expects the thesis to be thrown away. That’s my goal here. You don’t need to love your job. You can hate it.

### Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes

Conan Doyle disliked his creation. He felt Holmes was holding him back from occupying a more deserving position in literature.

### Curtly Ambrose — Cricket superstar

> He never liked cricket but was pushed by his mother s fanatic love for the game to take up the sport. My mother basically forced me to play cricket. And then to try and please her, I did. And like they say, the rest is history….  
> It was just a job. Then how can someone who didn’t like the game go on to achieve greatness? I am a proud man.… My pride basically was my motivation. I want to be the best at whatever I do. I strive for excellence. I don’t like to lose. Once I decided cricket was going to be my job, I just wanted to be the best. It’s a lot of hard work.
