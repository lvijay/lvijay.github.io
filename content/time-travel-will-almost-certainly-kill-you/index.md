The earth goes around the sun. Let’s start there. One way to see it is as depicted by the below animated GIF I found on Wikipedia.¹

undefined

Of course, the animation above isn’t accurate because our sun is at one of the foci of an ellipse around which the earth revolves but for the purposes of this post it doesn’t matter. Also, none of the images in this post are to scale etc.

Suppose now the following:

1.  I have a functioning time machine and
2.  It can _instantly_ take me backwards or forwards in time.  
    (We require that time travel take zero time because otherwise one could make the simple and accurate argument that we’re already time traveling at a rate of one second per second.)

Let us further suppose that at this time when I’m considering time travel, the earth is at position of its orbit shown below and I wish to travel 6 months into the future.

The position of the earth 6 months into the future is as follows:

undefined

To further illustrate my point, I’ve annotated the images to include me (not to scale).

Position when I start the time machine:

undefined

If I travel six months into the future, I end up as follows:

undefined

While the earth has moved I’m still exactly where the earth was. This, as we all know, does not end well for me.

On the plus side, no more blog posts such as these.

#### Addendum

Things are actually worse. Remember, the earth goes around the sun; the sun goes around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way — our galaxy; and the Milky Way is itself moving away from other galaxies. This constant motion does not bode well for time-travel. It also makes the mathematical calculations that much harder. (Possibly impossible but I’m not sure.)
