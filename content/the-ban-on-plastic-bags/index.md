> “We \[the governments of the world\] know what we need to do \[to fight Global Warming\], and we’re willing to do roughly half that.” — Naomi Klein, on the Paris Accords [¹](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/6/13/naomi_klein_climate_movement_is_growing)

A November 21 article in the New York Times by Daniel Victor discussed a sperm whale found off the coast of Indonesia with more than a 1,000 pieces of plastic in it[²](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/asia/whale-plastics-indonesia.html). (Warning: the video in the article is quite graphic. Do watch it.) The article also featured the following tweet in Indonesian that, thanks to the BBC[³](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46275742) and The Hindu[⁴](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/plastic-bottles-sandals-found-in-dead-whales-stomach/article25564267.ece), I was able to translate it as follows:

The whale had 5.9kg of plastic debris within it:

-   hard plastic, 19 pieces: 140g
-   plastic bottles, 4 pieces: 150g
-   plastic bags, 25 pieces: 260g
-   flip-flops, 2 pieces: 270g and
-   a sack with more than 1,000 pieces of string: 3.26kg

In India, the state of Tamil Nadu is banning plastic bags (260g of 5.9kg, i.e. 4.4% of the problem) but not other plastic items.

Go figure.
