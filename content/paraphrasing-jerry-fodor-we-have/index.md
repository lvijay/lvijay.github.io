Paraphrasing [Jerry Fodor](https://medium.com/galileo-onwards/newer-5068491938ec), we have:

“What’s wrong with the definition” of equating ‘books’ with ‘ideas’ is that “there are clear counterexamples” of ‘books’ that have no ‘ideas’. For instance, phonebooks, or ledger books, or brand new notebooks.

Furthermore, we can come up with other examples for “newer” which don’t involve books. For instance, if I frame and display a picture my son last yesterday, it’s clearly my newest artwork. However, if I purchase an original Raja Ravi Varma (1848–1906) tomorrow _that’ll_ be my newest.

The below link is a _real-life_ example of this. On Oct 19, 2019, Chicago’s Field Museum website had an article headlined, “[Newest Field Museum exhibition will highlight Native American women and warriors](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/press/newest-field-museum-exhibition-will-highlight-native-american-women-and-warriors)”. Note that their _newest_ exhibit is not necessarily their _most recently_ manufactured artifact.
