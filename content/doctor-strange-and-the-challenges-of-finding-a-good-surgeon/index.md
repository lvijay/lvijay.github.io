Picture this. You have an upcoming surgery and, you being you, demand nothing but the best in business. Luckily for you, you have data on the surgeons, their surgeries, how many were successful, how many were unsuccessful. Unluckily for you, you know nothing about your surgery or medicine. The question now becomes how far can you go? Can you find the best doctor? Can you at least separate the wheat from the chaff?

Now, two things to note: one, I donâ€™t actually have any data on surgeons (though I could google it)
