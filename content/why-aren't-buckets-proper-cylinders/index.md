“is it a bucket?” artwork by author. License: public domain.

_Question:_ Why aren’t buckets proper cylinders? Why are they instead shaped as _frustums—_cones with the bottom cut off?  
_Answer:_ Because frustum buckets stack within one another thereby saving space. Saved space means more buckets _per unit volume_, than corresponding regular cylinders. This translates to reduced costs.

Welcome to **Costs Matter**, a series that asks different questions all of which have the same answer: to better manage costs. The costs are frequently economic though not always. The series focuses narrowly on the impact of costs. It does not claim these costs are the sole cause.

A _frustum_ is an upside-down cone whose pointy end has been cut off. The following animated gif helps illustrate its construction.

#### Why do manufacturers prefer frustums over right cylinders?

Frustum shaped buckets can be placed inside one another thereby saving space. When space is saved manufacturers can store _more_ buckets in the same space than they could with regular cylinders. The same holds for wholesalers. For shippers, this means the same transport vehicles carry more units per volume than with other shapes. These correspondingly lead to reduced costs.

Buckets can be stacked as shown in the image below.

The question that follows is: why are right cylinders even manufactured? Who’s asking for cylinders and why?

That, dear reader, will be answered in next week’s Costs Matter post.
