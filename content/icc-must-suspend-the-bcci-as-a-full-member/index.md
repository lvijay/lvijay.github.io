Given the Indian Supreme Court’s [recent actions](http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1075059.html) viz., firing the BCCI’s president and secretary, it now falls upon the ICC to suspend the BCCI as a Full Member. I, for one, look forward to this because it won’t happen.

As per the ICC’s [document](http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-rules-and-regulations) titled “ICC Memorandum & Articles of Association — May 2016”, (PDF)

Quoting from the document, _Article 2.9 Independence of Member boards_

> Where a government interferes in the administration of cricket by a Member \[like the BCCI\], including but not limited to interference in operational matters… the Executive Board \[i.e. ICC\] shall have the power to suspend or refuse to recognise that Member, subject to the provisions of Article 2.7.

The relevant section from _Article 2.7 Suspension of Membership_ says “the Executive Board shall be entitled to suspend that Member with immediate effect from membership of the \[ICC\]” if the “Member shall:”

> lose its status as the governing body responsible for the administration, management and development of cricket in its Cricket Playing Country

And since this hasn’t happened — BCCI is still India’s Cricketing Body — Article 2.7 doesn’t apply.

Your move, ICC. Please suspend the richest cricket board.
