Charles Yang’s thesis, following that of his mentor, Noam Chomsky, is the poverty-of-stimulus argument.

Pointing wouldn’t work either. Quine too discusses the futility of point in _Word and Object._ See the sections on rabbit-fly for eg. Is the natives’ pointing at the rabbit a reference to its parts alone? (Or rabbithood? or hunting season?) Quine doesn’t leave much unturned.
