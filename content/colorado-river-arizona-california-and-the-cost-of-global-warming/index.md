The Colorado River is running low on water. This directly affects around 40 million people in 7 American States: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, and California.

> In 1968, Congress agreed to pay for the Central Arizona Project, an aqueduct that carries water from the Colorado to Phoenix and Tucson, and the farms that surround them. 

> In return for their support, California’s legislators insisted on a provision that their state’s water rights take priority over the aqueduct.

> If Arizona could have foreseen that climate change would permanently reduce the river’s flow, it might never have agreed to that deal, said Tom Buschatzke, director of the state’s Department of Water Resources.
