On October 2nd, French Prime Minister, Emmanuel Macron, decided he wanted to solve the Muslim problem because, according to him, Islam is “in crisis”.

In this post we’ll look this consistent phenomenon — where minority groups in larger groups are always in crisis or have poor culture and generally are a burden on society. I don’t claim it as an exhaustive study, not even illustrative. In fact, I’ll even try not to pass my own judgment which, for what it’s worth, is that minority groups are typically discriminated against and not accorded the French Revolution’s promise of liberty, equality, and fraternity will seem defective.

### Obama scolds black people

Since the start of his Presidential campaign Obama has only had one message for black people: their culture is defective, they don’t care about their children, they are not responsible. The following excerpt is from [June 2008](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/us/politics/15cnd-obama.html) when Obama was running for President:

> “Too many fathers are M.I.A, too many fathers are AWOL, missing from too many lives and too many homes,” Mr. Obama said, to a chorus of approving murmurs from the audience. “They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it.”  
> “Don’t get carried away with that eighth-grade graduation,… You’re supposed to graduate from eighth grade.”

In 2014, Obama founded an initiative called “My Brother’s Keeper” whose mission is “to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and to ensure all youth can reach their full potential”. \[see also [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/my-brothers-keeper-obama.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/my-brothers-keeper-obama.html)\]
