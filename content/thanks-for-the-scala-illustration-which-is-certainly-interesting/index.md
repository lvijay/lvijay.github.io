Thanks for the Scala illustration which is certainly interesting. I think, however, that you’re missing the point.

My post had two goals and one explicit non-goal. The first: to just discuss the concept of Currying; the second: to illustrate how one would achieve this in the Java Programming Language. The explicit non-goal? “No part of this is actually recommended for use in a production system.”

If someone tried to write Java code as illustrated in this post, it would not pass my code review.
