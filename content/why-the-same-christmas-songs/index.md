The comic [xkcd 988](https://xkcd.com/988/) claims “every year, American culture embarks on a massive project to carefully recreate the Christmases of baby boomers’ childhoods”. The comic itself shows a graph of the 20 most played _Christmas_ songs in the decade 2000–2009.

_Question:_ Why do the radio stations play the same songs from the 50s?  
_Answer:_ that’s when the tradition of playing songs on the radio emerged.

The xkcd comic is shown below. We’ll discuss the answer after the comic.

A tradition, once established, becomes the norm and changing norms is often _more_ expensive than abiding by the norm.
