_Question_: Why do female reindeer have antlers? It only gets in their way.  
_Answer_: Because the males need them and it’s biologically too expensive for a reindeer to develop with the specification that females _not_ have antlers.

Welcome to **Costs Matter**, a series that asks different questions all of which have the same answer: to better manage costs. The costs are frequently economic though not always. The series focuses narrowly on the impact of costs. It does not claim these costs are the sole cause.

#### The peacock’s feather

> “The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!” — Charles Darwin, letter to Asa Gray, April 1860 \[[ref](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2088/2088-h/2088-h.htm)\].

A few months after he wrote his most famous book introducing the theory of evolution by natural selection, Darwin wrote the above quote about peacocks to the American scientist Asa Gray. Darwin’s theory predicted that animals would retain traits that helped them survive until reproduction. (In later editions he would introduce the term “survival of the fittest” to describe this phenomenon.) Darwin couldn’t understand why organisms developed structures that, rather than helping them survive, actually _reduced_ their fitness—the peacock’s tail being a prime example here. How did a peacock develop such an elaborate tail that makes it _more_ susceptible to predation? Darwin, who would appreciate _Costs Matter_, could not understand what causal chain led to such a costly trait. What do you do when the facts don’t mesh with your theory? Confess it makes you sick.

He did eventually come up with a theory that explained the phenomenon. He described it in his book “_The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_”. He said, in addition to _natural selection_, there was also _sexual selection_, in which sexes _within_ the same species compete with their own sex (males with males, females with females) to find mates and reproduce. Thus a peahen decides among many dancing peacocks — male peacocks compete with each other to get the attention of a peahen. But what does all this have to do with antlers on female reindeer, you ask? Yes, let’s get right to them.

#### Female reindeer antlers

Darwin discussed reindeer in _The Descent of Man_. He compared several deer species. He observed that _antlers_ were only used by the males to compete with one another for females, there were several species of deer in which only the males had antlers. Reindeer were an exception to this though. Why? He said:

> It is in itself probable that any character appearing at an early age would tend to be inherited equally by both sexes, for the sexes do not differ much in constitution before the power of reproduction is gained. 

So rule one is if the species has common development pathways for males and females, then it’s probable both sexes will get the same characteristics later in life. Darwin noted,

> An excellent case for investigation is afforded by the Deer family. In all the species, but one, the horns are developed only in the males, though certainly transmitted through the females, and capable of abnormal development in them. In the reindeer, on the other hand, the female is provided with horns; so that in this species, the horns ought, according to our rule, to appear early in life, long before the two sexes are mature and have come to differ much in constitution. In all the other species the horns ought to appear later in life, which would lead to their development in that sex alone, in which they first appeared in the progenitor of the whole Family.

In brief, female reindeer have horns because they develop early in their life, before their sexual maturation. _Why_ do they appear early in reindeer life? I
