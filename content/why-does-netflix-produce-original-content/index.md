_Question:_ Why does Netflix produce original content?  
_Answer_: The costs of producing original content offset Netflix’s licensing fees.

### Netflix’s Costs

When a Netflix user watches a video Netflix has two costs:

1.  **Internet**: When people watch a video on Netflix, they’re downloading data from Netflix’s servers. Netflix has to pay a fee proportional to the number of bytes its viewers download. (This is why Netflix’s fees progressively increase based on the video resolution.)
2.  **Licensing**: when Netflix viewers stream a video whose license is owned by, say, MGM, Netflix pays MGM a fee.

Note that Netflix pays no _licensing fee_ when it owns the content.

These two simple points give us our answer. We can ignore (1) since it is a constant — data is billed in bytes transmitted not on the quality of the content.

#### Estimation

Let’s suppose the following  
_Production cost_ _\=_ $10 million  
_Number of viewers_ _\=_ 10 million  
∴ Cost per view = $1

If Netflix’s licensing costs exceed $1 per view they are better off producing original content.

### Reality Check

> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. — anon.

According to the website [whats-on-netflix.com](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/every-viewing-statistic-netflix-has-released-so-far-february-2021/), the 2020 movie, _Extraction_, had an estimated 90M views in its first 4 weeks. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_%282020_film%29) says its budget was $65M. That works out to cost of $0.72 per view.

Further, remember that Netflix original content, once produced, is forever. Netflix has no recurring licensing costs to pay, no licensing renewals or negotiations.
