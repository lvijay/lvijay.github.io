Global Warming related articles from the months of July and August 2020

1.  3-D printed Terra-cotta restoring Coral Reefs
2.  Brazil continued deforestation of the Amazon rainforests

#### **Terra-cotta restoring Coral Reefs (Aug 3, 2020)**

by Lilly Smith, [https://www.fastcompany.com/90534835/these-3d-printed-tiles-are-helping-restore-devastated-coral-reefs](https://www.fastcompany.com/90534835/these-3d-printed-tiles-are-helping-restore-devastated-coral-reefs).

In July, marine scientists from Hong Kong’s Swire Institute of Marine Science ([SWIMS](https://www.swims.hku.hk/)) 3-D printed interlocking terra-cotta tiles and placed them in Hong Kong’s marine park as a barrier reef. They hope this will increase coral growth in the reef which has declined by 80% over the last decade. They will monitor coral growth over the next two years.

-   Where will their monitoring be published?  
    Because this is a government contracted research effort — the researchers are not permitted to make the data/progress public. After the project ends, they will work with the government to make public what they can.
-   Who are the researchers behind this?

#### Brazil continued deforestation of the Amazon rainforests

_Science_ Article: “Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is still rising sharply” by Herton Escobar, Aug 07, 2020, [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/613](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/613)

From the first article by Herton Escobar:

> Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has risen sharply in the past year — again. Estimates set to be released this week by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) will show clearings have increased by at least 28% during the current monitoring year, which runs from August through July, compared with the previous year. It is the **second steep hike under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro**, who has made good on his campaign promise to loosen environmental law enforcement and step up development \[sic, it should be called exploitation\] in the Amazon. \[my emphasis\]

From the second letter by de Oliveira et al., we have:

> Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between January and June (3070 km²) was 25% higher than it was during the same period in 2019 (2446 km²) and 46% higher than the 4-year average of January through June from 2016 to 2019 (2108 km²). Within Indigenous lands, which make up 23% of the Brazilian Amazon, deforestation quadrupled in the past 4 years (from 105 km2 in 2016 to 497 km² in 2019). Fire is intrinsic to the deforestation process — forest is left to dry after cutting and then burned to prepare for agriculture. The majority of deforested land in 2020, and 45% of the trees cut in 2019, has remained unburned. Between July and December this year, under dry conditions, most of this land will be set ablaze.

On its own deforestation only affects our longer term survival (now in decades rather than centuries). Thus short term corporate profits can be prioritized above their preservation, deforestation by fire poses more immediate problems loom—the fires “are responsible for 80% of increases in fine particulate pollution (PM₂.₅) regionally, affecting 24 million Amazonians” and they could “aggravate the current COVID-19 crisis”. The positive is that indigenous peoples of the Amazon are dying at 1.5x the rate as the rest of Brazil’s population. This is a positive because President Jair Bolsonaro has a documented record of comments against Brazil’s indigenous populations. See Tom Phillips’s [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/jair-bolsonaro-racist-comment-sparks-outrage-indigenous-groups) in The Guardian from Jan 24, 2020 and a short list of other [comments](https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3540-Bolsonaro) he’s made about them in Survival International. (One gem, is this comment from 1998: “it’s a shame that the Brazilian cavalry hasn’t been as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated the Indians”.)

The first letter, refers to Brazil reopening a highway project, Highway BR-319, which was built in 1973 but abandoned in 1988. “With BR-319 and its planned side roads open to traffic, the deforested area would likely increase to more than 1200% of the 2011 level by 2100…. The huge block of forest opened to deforestation by these roads _contains a carbon stock that, if released, would greatly increase the chances that global mitigation efforts will fail to contain climate change_”. The Brazilian government is going ahead with this project without an environmental assessment even though a Brazilian court ordered one.

The letters authors also justifiably fear this “failure of the government to abide by the judicial decision will set a dangerous precedent for other mega-developments in the Amazon, including hydroelectric dams and the Barão do Rio Branco project, which would build a road through a series of areas protected for traditional peoples and for biodiversity”.

#### Public pressure works

The silver lining is that public pressure on governments works. This is brought up both in both Escobar’s article (“pressured by public opinion and investors concerned about sustainability, Bolsonaro has taken some steps to protect the forest”) and in the letter from Nazareno et al.

Thus, continued and sustained pressure is necessary and matters. Necessary though hardly sufficient.
