“_I am Groot_” are the only words the tree creature, Groot, can say. Though he understands what’s said to him and responds appropriately those three words in that order are the only things he’s capable of saying.

We all know Groot from the Marvel movies, _The Guardians of the Galaxy_, _Avengers: Infinity War_, and _Avengers: Endgame_. What many don’t know is that there is (or was) a real life analogue to Groot. I don’t mean a tree like creature, I mean there was a man who could understand everything said to him but was extremely limited in his responses. Specifically, the only phrase he was capable of was_, “Tan_”.

According to Marvel lore, (I’m citing from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groot) here):

> Groot is a _Flora colossus_ from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. The _Flora colossi_ are tree-like beings whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their larynxes, causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase “I am Groot”.

The human equivalent was Louis Victor Leborgne. Here’s how linguist Andrea Moro describes him in his 2008 book [_The Boundaries of Babel_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/boundaries-babel)_:_

> In 1811, Monsieur Leborgne arrived at the Bicêtre Hospital in Paris. He was a twenty-one-year-old man who exhibited an unusual linguistic problem: Whenever he was asked a question, he would always answer by saying one syllable twice, _tan tan_, in conjunction with quite varied intonation and expressive gestures.

As all _Avengers_’ (movie) fans know, “whenever Groot is saying the trademark ‘I am Groot!’ he has actually been saying a number of things, and his varying inflections of the sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences.” (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groot) again).

#### End notes

1.  I wasn’t able to discover if Groot’s creators (Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby) were aware of Tan’s existence.
2.  The consequences of Leborgne’s condition were better investigated when, in 1861, Paul Broca found him. You can read about it in Broca’s Wikipedia page under the section “[Broca’s Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Broca#Broca%27s_Area)”.
3.  If you want to read more about language and neuroscience, Andrea Moro’s _The Boundaries of Babel_ is a great book. The 2nd edition came out in 2015.

4.  This blog post in the magazine Scientific American is a good summary on the neuroscience side of things.
