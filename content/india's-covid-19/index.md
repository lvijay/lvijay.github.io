[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/13-billion-people-21-day-lockdown-can-india-curb-coronavirus](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/13-billion-people-21-day-lockdown-can-india-curb-coronavirus) Science Magazine has a “but” half way thru its article accepting that India’s doing the exact right thing.

The Economist: “the Modi government decided that its priority was speed. Perhaps as a result it has fatally bungled the shutdown.” Halfway into the paragraph, they admit that India has a plan, “India is aiming to slow its epidemic, delaying cases to when new treatments are available and its health-care system is better prepared”.
