It’s my thesis here that Sherlock Holmes’s arch-nemesis, Prof. James Moriarty, was not an arch-villain but an innocent and badly wronged man. Holmes used him as an elaborate ruse to get away for an extended period of time. _Why_ Holmes did so, I neither know nor speculate upon.

It’s a well known fact that Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes so he could concentrate on his [other writings](http://gutenberg.net.au/pages/doyle.html). I don’t take that into account here. My account will be purely within the realm of what might be called the Sherlock-Holmes-Universe. (And if you’re amongst the smart alecs who wish to point out that Sherlock Holmes isn’t real, well, you know the way out.)

#### Does Moriarty Exist?

This is a serious point to consider.

I’d be tempted to consider that Prof. James Moriarty was entirely a figment of Sherlock Holmes’s imagination except for this one line penned by Dr. Watson, in _The Final Problem:_

> My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred.

My guess is that Colonel Moriarty’s letter professes the innocence of his brother. And there’s nothing in _The Final Problem_ to suggest that the Colonel is wrong. As we shall see, Professor Moriarty is a phantom. We never see him, we never hear him. We only have Watson’s description of _a_ man Watson has neither spoken to nor heard identify himself as Moriarty. The situation can be likened to the trick played on John “Scottie” Ferguson in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 thriller, _Vertigo_.

#### Consider the source

Everything we know of Moriarty is from Holmes. There are no third party corroborations for any of this.

Throughout _The Final Problem_, we Holmes describes Moriarty as an evil mastermind but offers no proof whatsoever. It has all the tells of a conspiracy theory where a lack of evidence presented as strengthening the thesis.

Consider the below introduction to Moriarty with this in mind.

> “You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?” said \[Sherlock Holmes\].

> “Never,” \[said Watson\].

> “Aye, there’s the genius and the wonder of the thing!” he cried. “The man pervades London, **_and no one has heard of him_**. **_That’s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime_**.” \[my emphasis\]

As Holmes continues, we see that at worst Prof. Moriarty is an unpopular figure, acknowledged to be bright who loses his University job as a consequence of unproven rumors.

> “\[Moriarty\]’s career has been an extraordinary one…. At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise… \[o\]n the strength of \[which\] he won the Mathematical Chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearance, a most brilliant career before him…. \[But\] \[d\]ark rumors gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an army coach.

It’s tragic that an admittedly brilliant mathematician has his career cut short on account of unproven “dark rumors”.

Holmes continues with his conspiracy theory:

> “As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do. For years past I have continually been **_conscious of some power behind the malefactor_**, some deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws it shield over the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts — forgery cases, robberies, murders — I have **_felt_** the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavored to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity. \[my emphasis\]

Readers familiar with the Sherlock Holmes canon will recognize how unlike Holmes the above paragraph is. Holmes regularly eschews “feelings”, preferring to rely on logic and deduction. Consider this from _The Sign of Four_: “Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.” Or consider this from _The Boscombe Valley Mystery_, “\[circumstantial evidence\] may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different”. The cold, calculating Holmes speaking about “feeling” a “malefactor” without providing evidence is strongly out of character.

When continuing his elaboration above, Holmes gives away the game by admitting that Moriarty “does little himself” and that “do what \[Holmes\] would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict \[Moriarty\] in a court of law.”

### Alternative theory

We all know from Dr. James Watson that Sherlock Holmes is a mastermind and we know nothing about Prof. Moriarty himself. So we’ll stick to what we know.

It’s my thesis that Sherlock Holmes himself was living a double life of criminal mastermind and master detective, and wishing to take a break, blamed the innocent but now disgraced Mr. James Moriarty, possibly murdered him, and vanished for a few years. (Think Fight Club

As I mentioned above, we must speculate about the contents of Col. Moriarty’s letter, defending his brother. It’s my additional thesis that the colonel’s letter absolved his brother of all involvement in the affairs of Sherlock Holmes. _The Final Problem_ is Watson’s recounting of the affairs that led to (as it turns out) Holmes faking his own death. Nothing in that story contradicts what I’ll be laying out in this post.

In the very first Sherlock Holmes novel, _A Study In Scarlet_, he expresses disdain for both the ordinary criminal and the ordinary detective.

> There are no crimes and no criminals in these days…. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.

In _A Sign of Four_, Watson recognizes that his friend could make an excellent criminal if he so chose, “I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense.”

#### What do we know of Moriarty, Part II?

Watson has never seen Moriarty. He sees a man who’s identified by Holmes as Moriarty. He later sees the same man walking down a narrow path towards where Holmes was. Beyond that Watson sees nothing, hears nothing, and the story ends.

> \[Moriarty\] is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in this head. He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion.

A little while later, Holmes has dragged Watson to a train to escape detection, and, like clockwork, who should appear but, in Holmes’s words, “Ah, there is Moriarty himself.” Classic magicians misdirection, in my opinion.

The man they see is, in Watson’s words, “a tall man”. Watson sees no man fitting this description after this.

#### Holmes’s death

As they make their escape from the phantasm known as Moriarty, Holmes’s well laid plan to capture Moriarty’s gang succeeds. He tells Watson the police “have secured the whole gang with the exception of \[Moriarty, who\] has given them the slip”. How convenient for Holmes.

### Appendix

#### Why do the Moriarty Brothers have the same first name?

Nowhere in The Final Problem is Prof. Moriarty’s first name mentioned. He’s only referred to as “Prof. Moriarty” and his brother is named “Colonel James Moriarty”. The first time we encounter the professor’s first name is in _The Adventure of the Empty House_, published 1903, a whole decade after _The Final Problem_’s publication in 1893. Remember, Conan Doyle wanted to end his hero so he could concentrate on his other tales. I’m guessing Conan Doyle’s go-to first name was “James”.

Scanning the names in his books bears this out. “James” was his second most common name was “James”. Narrowly losing to “John”.
