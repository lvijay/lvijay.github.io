_Question:_ Why are there more models of a washing machine than there are manuals for them?  
_Answer:_ It is cheaper to print fewer manuals than it is to print one for each washing machine.

#### Example

The href below is the manual for at least 5 Samsung washing-machines “WA75M4\*\*\*\*/WA70M4\*\*\*\*/WA65M4\*\*\*\*/WA62M4\*\*\*\*/WA60M4\*\*\*\*”. Note that the “`****`” are in the original, I haven’t redacted anything. The link is: [https://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201807/20180717113521560/WA4000HS-DC68-03636C\_EN\_R.pdf](https://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201807/20180717113521560/WA4000HS-DC68-03636C_EN_R.pdf).

#### Why

Reading through the manual is a strange experience. At times they don’t know what features your washing machine has.
