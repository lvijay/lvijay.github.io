The UN COP25 conference ended yesterday, Dec 15, 2019. It was originally scheduled to go on from Dec 2 to Dec 13 but extended two additional days. Of course, you wouldn’t know this by looking at today’s Economic Times.

Below are two photos of the ET. There isn’t a single mention about COP25 even having taken place.

The most reasonable conclusion one can take from this is that the Economic Times editors do not care about human survival because it’s no exaggeration that Climate Change/Global Warming is the biggest existential threat currently facing humanity.

Here’s a second example: this from the _Times of India_. I don’t subscribe to it but here’s a screenshot of its website, [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/). There are exactly two mentions of the climate. The image itself is a long scroll but don’t be looking for the climate mentions. I show them separately after the screenshot.

The two snippets from the above website are shown below. In one case it’s mentioned in the _Environment_ section but doesn’t merit top mention. It seems the _Times_’s editors value turtles and dolphins more than they do the overall ecosystem. The second mention is under _Women_. I don’t know why.

> It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice either of them. — Mark Twain, [Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar](http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/wilson/pwequat.html)

India is ostensibly a democracy. But, as shown by its media, Indians can hardly make reasonable decisions when their media are quite serious about keeping them in the dark.

And the effects of such excellent media coverage (or lack thereof) have their effects. For instance, below is what the UN website said ([https://unclimatesummit.org](https://unclimatesummit.org)):

> Governments have failed to respond to the emergency of the climate crisis as the talks fell victim to major differences between countries that are proving hard to resolve….

> Canada, Japan, China and **_India_** were also faulted for their complacency as they failed to support vulnerable nations in the face of brutal impacts and push for a more robust collective response in 2020. \[emphasis added\]

_The Economic Times_, is acting in a manner as described by the below _New Yorker_ comic.
